# Data Structures Assignment Template

Welcome to the Data Structures Assignment!

In this repository, you will implement and test several basic data structures. The goal is to understand and implement core data structures in Python.

## Data Structures to Implement:

- **Array**
- **Stack**
- **Queue**

## Instructions:

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Implement the data structures as specified in `data_structures.py`.
3. Write test cases to verify that your data structures work correctly (in `main.py`).
4. Commit and push your changes regularly.

## How to Run:

### Running Your Implementation:
1. Clone your forked repository.
2. Implement the data structures in `data_structures.py`.
3. Use `main.py` to test your data structures.

To test the implementation, run the following command:

```bash
python main.py
